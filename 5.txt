Web scraping, often called web crawling or web spidering, or “programmatically going over a collection of web pages and extracting data,” is a powerful tool 
for working with data on the web.With a web scraper, you can mine data about a set of products, get a large corpus of text or quantitative data to play around
with, get data from a site without an official API.
